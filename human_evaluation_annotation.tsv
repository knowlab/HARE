The pathology report describes a Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a breast tumor sample showing that the HER-2/neu gene is not amplified but has a ratio over Chromosome 17 of 1.4. The report also shows metastatic mullerian-derived carcinoma in various organs including the omentum, fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, cervix, vermiform appendix, cul-de-sac, soft tissue on both side walls, and skin of umbilicus. The tumor is composed of serous and undifferentiated components, and is high-grade (3/3). Lymphovascular invasion is present, as well as extensive tumor involvement in all sites, and significant invasion of the muscular wall of the uterus and cervix. The immunohistochemical analysis shows a positive Estrogen receptor in about 70% of neoplastic cells, a positive Progesterone receptor in less than 10% of neoplastic cells, and few (less than 3%) of the neoplastic cells exhibit positive staining for Epidermal growth factor receptor. The report also mentions a polysomy of chromosome 7 in 65% of nuclei examined in an ovary tumor sample from the patient, which is indicative of an amplified EGFR signal pattern.

The pathology report describes a fresh, intact right eye globe specimen with a nodular, pale mass seen on opening, indicative of a virtually non-pigmented choroidal melanoma. The melanoma is composed predominantly of spindle cells with a mitotic frequency of approximately 4/40 high power fields. Closed loops are focally present on the planes of sections, while lymphocytic infiltrate and tumour necrosis are not seen. The report confirms the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma of predominantly spindle cell type, and supplementary reports will follow.	"**Histopathology Report**

**Specimen Site:** Eye and adnexa  

**Microscopic Description:**  
The section shows the globe of the eye with preserved architecture. The sclera, cornea, and lens are identifiable. The retina appears detached in areas. There is a well-demarcated, densely cellular lesion within the vitreous cavity, exhibiting a proliferation of small, round, basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are noted. Adjacent areas show hemorrhage and necrosis. No evidence of invasion into the sclera or extraocular tissue is observed.  

**Diagnosis:**  
Findings are consistent with a small, round blue cell tumor, suggestive of retinoblastoma. Further immunohistochemical staining is recommended for confirmation."	"**Histopathology Report**

**Specimen Site:** Eye and Adnexa  
**Date of Examination:** [Not Provided]  
**Microscopic Description:**  
The whole slide image reveals a section of ocular tissue demonstrating an abnormal mass. The lesion is characterized by a well-circumscribed area of hypercellularity, with predominant cellularity comprising atypical epithelial cells. The background shows areas of necrosis and inflammation. The surrounding stroma exhibits reactive changes with increased vascularity.

The findings are suggestive of a neoplastic process, potentially indicating a malignant tumor of the eye. Further immunohistochemical studies are recommended for definitive characterization.

**Recommendations:**  
1. Correlate with clinical findings and imaging studies.  
2. Consider additional molecular studies if indicated.  
3. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist for comprehensive management.
